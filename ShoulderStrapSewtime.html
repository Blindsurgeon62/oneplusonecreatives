        <p> Working on this made me realize, once again, how easy it is to get in our own way. By focusing on things that we erroneously conclude deserve more energy and consideration than is truly warranted, the joy inherent in making gets watered down. I'm not sure when this clicked for me, but it did. If I needed to stop and learn the "proper" way of doing something before I was comfortable giving it a go, I would become discouraged. After being reminded of my inadequacies (imagined or otherwise), I wouldn't want to continue. </p>
		<p> Failing to live up to the preconceptions I have about what I should be able to do (it can't be that hard, can it?), before looking at similar projects online and getting a whiff of that insidious disappointment hidden within comparison... that doesn't sound fun at all!   Learning the proper way to [enter esoteric skill here] just to feel adequate enough to start in the first place… will destroy any momentum you have! </p>
		<p> I constantly remind myself to be graceful with my expectations, and to remember why I'm doing this thing in the first place… Not to win, or for bragging rights, but to explore, learn, expand, or help! Striving for excellence in all things is admirable, this is true. But allowing your inability to do something right the first time to stop you from starting in the first place... that's just a bummer.
		<p> So, the next time you are thinking about sewing a patch onto a backpack, painting a picture, or making a grilled cheese, and you feel overwhelmed, remember that something is better than nothing, and you will be better for it!</p>
