// Homepage feature blurb
const makersFeatureText = "In the time I've had in this life so far, I've been blessed through meetings with lots of great people. This is my chance to share some of them with you! These are folks that are making things that matter to them - people who inspired me with how they took the step past thinking about something into actually doing. They're proof that you don't need permission to start creating. You just need to start.";
